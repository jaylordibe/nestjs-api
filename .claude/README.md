# Claude Code tooling

Team-shared Claude Code assets for this NestJS + Prisma starter: an agentic **ticket-to-diff pipeline** and the guardrails that keep it inside the house rules. Everything here is committed, so a project scaffolded from this template inherits the workflow — the only per-machine step is a one-time issue-tracker login (below).

This is developer *tooling*, not part of the API. The API builds, runs, and tests with none of it. If you don't use Claude Code, ignore this directory.

## The ticket-to-diff pipeline

`/ticket <TICKET-KEY | pasted ticket text>` drives a ticket through seven stages and **stops at two human gates** — it never implements without an approved plan and never commits or pushes.

| Stage | What runs | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Understand | `context-mapper` agent produces a read-only impact map (touched files, contract surface, security surface, downstream consumers, tests implied) | |
| 2. Plan | An ADR-style plan in Plan mode | 🛑 **GATE 1** — waits for your approval before any edit |
| 3. Implement | Builds exactly the approved plan to the `CLAUDE.md` engineering bar | |
| 4. Review | `/code-review` + `/security-review` + `/simplify`, findings folded back in | |
| 5. Verify | `yarn build` + `yarn lint` + the affected `yarn test:e2e` spec(s) + `/verify` | |
| 6. Present | Diff summary + review/verify results + downstream-consumer handoff | 🛑 **GATE 2** — you commit; no git write ever runs |
| 7. Report | Posts one plain-English wrap-up comment on the issue | Status untouched — **you** move the board column after you push |

The conductor keeps a durable seven-stage todo checklist so the pipeline survives a long plan discussion (or a context summarization) and resumes at the right stage on approval, rather than treating "looks good" as a fresh request.

**A ticket is a claim to validate, not a spec to transcribe.** Its author is usually end-goal focused and not deeply technical, and tickets go stale — so Stage 1 reconciles every factual claim against the source and grades the approach the ticket prescribes, and Stage 2 recommends the approach the evidence supports rather than the one the ticket happened to name. The pipeline separates the outcome wanted (the WHAT) from the method named (the HOW); a faithful build of the wrong thing is still wrong, and a genuine product decision is routed back to the human instead of being decided silently.

**Stage 7 writes a comment, never a status.** The comment is for the reporter, QA, and standup — plain English, no file paths or function names — and answers three questions: what behaviour changed, what changed *beyond* what the ticket asked, and what is still blocking. The PR carries the reasoning and the diff; the ticket comment does not duplicate it. Moving the ticket across the board stays a human act, because at comment time the work exists only in your working tree.

### Components

- **`commands/ticket.md`** — the conductor (the `/ticket` command). A prompt, not a state machine; the checklist is its durable memory.
- **`agents/context-mapper.md`** — a read-only (`Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`Bash`) specialist that scopes a ticket's full blast radius. Never edits.

### Design principle

Buy the engines, build only the specialists and the conductor. Review (`/code-review`, `/security-review`, `/simplify`), verification (`/verify`), search (`Explore`), and the plan gate (Plan mode) are all built-ins — we never reimplement them. The only custom assets are the two files above plus the guardrails below.

## Guardrails (`settings.json` hooks)

Enforced by the harness, not by an agent remembering:

- **git write block** — a `PreToolUse` hook denies any `git commit` / `git push`. All git writes are the human's.
- **issue transition block** — a `PreToolUse` hook denies `transitionJiraIssue` / `editJiraIssue` on any MCP server. Stage 7 may comment; it may never move a ticket or change its fields.
- **migration-edit guard** — a `PreToolUse` hook asks before editing anything under `prisma/migrations/` (never edit an applied migration; add a new one).

## One-time setup: connect your issue tracker (MCP)

The repo commits **`.mcp.json`** declaring an Atlassian (Jira / Confluence) MCP server. No secret lives in it — the connection is per-developer OAuth, so nothing sensitive is ever committed. To enable it once, per machine:

1. Open the repo in Claude Code and approve the `atlassian` server when prompted.
2. Run `/mcp` → select **atlassian** → **Authenticate** → approve in the browser.

Once done, Stage 1 of `/ticket TICKET-123` auto-fetches the issue. Without it, paste the ticket text into `/ticket` instead — the rest of the pipeline is identical. **Not using Jira?** Delete `.mcp.json` (or swap in your tracker's MCP server); the pipeline still works with pasted text.

> **Scaffolding a real project from this template?** Rename the server from the generic `atlassian` (in `.mcp.json` and the two references above) to a project-specific name like `atlassian-<your-project>`. Claude Code keys the OAuth token by server name, so two projects sharing the name `atlassian` would share one Atlassian account/workspace — distinct names keep them separate.

## Deferred

- An `implementer` agent + git-worktree fan-out for parallel implementation (only worth building when a ticket genuinely needs concurrent, isolated edits).
