# Approve or reject a design

## What this gate is

`disable-model-invocation: true` is the security control that makes this skill
safe: **Claude can never invoke it.** Only a human typing `/gate-approve` starts
it, so Claude cannot approve its own design no matter what it concludes.

That control lives in the frontmatter, not in any file the approval gets written
to.

**Never infer approval.** "Looks good", "nice", "ok" while discussing something
else is not an approval. If this skill was invoked, the user intends to decide
now; if their instruction is ambiguous about *which* decision, ask.

## 1. Establish what is being decided

There must be a design on the table — a plan `/gate-design` presented in this
session, or one the user has just described. If there is not, say so and stop;
there is nothing to approve.

If the design is more than a few days old or the worktree has moved under it,
**re-verify it against the repository before reading it back.** Approving a
design whose evidence has gone stale is approving a decision about a codebase
that no longer exists. Say plainly if anything no longer holds, and recommend
`/gate-design` instead.

## 2. Read it back before they decide

An approval nobody re-read is a rubber stamp, and the whole value of this gate is
that it is the last moment before source changes. Present, concisely and in your
own words rather than quoted:

- the **recommendation**, and the trade-off accepted by rejecting the
  alternatives;
- **contract and data impact**, if any, naming affected consumers;
- **residual security and privacy risk**;
- the **rollback or roll-forward path**;
- **what this deliberately does NOT do** — scope disappointment surfaces here far
  more often than technical objection;
- **every unresolved blocker, individually.**

## 3. Unresolved blockers

If anything is unresolved, the user must either resolve it or **explicitly accept
it as a condition**. Name each one and ask which. Do not let an open blocker pass
silently into an approval — record exactly what they said they were accepting,
verbatim, never paraphrased.

If a blocker questions whether the change should happen at all, say so directly
and offer rejection as the live option it is.

## 4. Take the decision

Only after an explicit, unambiguous decision this turn.

**On approval**, state back in one line: what was approved, and any conditions in
the user's own words. Those conditions bind the implementation exactly as the
design does — if one adds scope, the implementation covers it; if one removes
scope, the implementation stops there.

**On rejection**, say what would have to change for a new design to supersede
this one, and stop.

There is no `Status:` line and no file to write. The approval is the decision
itself, and it authorises `/gate-implement` in this session only — it does not
carry to a later one, where the design would have to be presented again.

## 5. Stop

Do not implement, commit, push, or apply a migration. The user owns the commit
that makes this approval real.

## 6. Handoff

Follow `.claude/standards/gate-handoff.md`, starting with its §0 mode table.

On approval, offer to continue into `/gate-implement` in this session, or to stop
so they run it themselves. Recommend stopping when the change is High or Critical
risk.

On rejection there is no next gate.

### This gate is not part of a `/work-item` run

A live pipeline takes its own approval inline at Stage 2, from an `ExitPlanMode`
decision — see `.claude/skills/work-item/SKILL.md`. It does not route through
this command, and it must not ask a second time after the user has already
approved: that is one decision, presented twice.

This skill is for a design decided **outside** that flow — presented in an
earlier session, resumed after compaction, or produced by `/gate-design`
standalone.
